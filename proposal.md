# Mercedes-Benz Sales Insights Dashboard (2020–2025)

## 1. Motivation and Purpose
We are a team of data science students. We aim to explore how vehicle types and configurations impact the sales performance of cars in global markets. As hybrid and electric power technologies gain increasing popularity, automakers need further insights into which combinations of fuel type, pricing, and horsepower best meet consumer demand. Understanding the relationships between these factors and sales volume can help support more informed decisions in inventory planning, product strategy, and market positioning. To achieve this, we utilize a large and comprehensive dataset of Mercedes-Benz vehicle sales from 2020 to 2025 from Kaggle. This dataset allows us to analyze how combinations of different fuel types, horsepower, turbo configurations, and price ranges influence vehicle sales performance. By studying these patterns, we aim to reveal the relationship between product characteristics and market demand, thereby gaining meaningful insights.

In this project. we aim to develop an interactive dashboard that enable users to explore automotive sales data. The dashboard helps users identify which vehicles perform best in the market and determine which aspects consumers prioritize when selecting vehicles (e.g. Color, Turbo).It also track shifts in demand for electric and hybrid vehicles to help automakers decide whether to increase R&D and production budgets for these powertrains. By analyzing dashboard data, users and dealers can make more informed strategic market decisions.
