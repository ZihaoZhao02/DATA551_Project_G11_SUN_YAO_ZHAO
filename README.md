## Description of the App
This interactive dashboard is designed to help users explore Mercedes-Benz sales patterns and trends between 2020 and 2025. It visually presents sales performance differences across different models, fuel types, prices, performance configurations, and colors. The goal is to help car dealers, developers, company leaders, and any staff who make strategies to understand market demand and consumer preferences.

Users can start with an overview of the entire sales trends and how fuel type (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, electric) distribution changes over time. Interactive filters allow users to focus on specific year ranges, model types, fuel types, turbocharged configurations, and value ranges such as price or horsepower. These filters dynamically update all charts, facilitating comparisons of different market segments.

The dashboard includes several main visualization panels, including the time based trend charts, best selling model comparisons, the relationship between price and horsepower, and performance configuration distribution. A dedicated color analysis view helps users understand differences in exterior color preferences across different models and years. Furthermore, users can highlight relevant data in other charts by clicking on models or categories within the charts.
