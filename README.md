# Mercedes–Benz Sales Insights Dashboard (2020–2025)
Interactive dashboard for exploring Mercedes-Benz sales, pricing, and powertrain trends (2020-2025).


## Target Users 
Regional dealership managers and everyone who need to understand changing market demand and evolving consumer preferences.


## Description of the App
This interactive dashboard is designed to help users explore Mercedes-Benz sales patterns and trends between 2020 and 2025. It visually presents sales performance differences across different models, fuel types, prices, performance configurations, and colors. The goal is to help car dealers, developers, company leaders, and any staff who make strategies to understand market demand and consumer preferences.

The interface employs a top level overview section and a coordinated structure of multiple visualization panels below. This allows users to gradually delve from macro trends to more detailed comparative analyses. The dashboard contains approximately 4-5 main visualization panels, each focusing on a different aspect of vehicle sales performance. These panels include sales trend graphs based on tome, the best selling model comparisons, relationship between horsepower and price, performance configuration distributions, and dedicated color preference analysis.

Users can start with an overview of the entire sales trends and how fuel type (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, electric) distribution changes over time. Interactive filters allow users to focus on specific year ranges, model types, fuel types, turbocharged configurations, and value ranges such as price or horsepower. These filters dynamically update all charts, enabling users to compare different market segments and quickly identify meaningful patterns.

The dashboard also supports interactive exploration. Users can click on vehicle models, fuel types, or other categories in the charts to highlight relevant data within the dashboard. This interaction provides users with a clearer perspective, such as switching from a macro level market overview to a detailed analysis of a specific model or configuration. By integrating multiple related views into a single interface, the dashboard helps users translate data insights into practical decisions, such as adjusting inventory mix, optimizing product positioning, and responding to the growth of electric and hybrid vehicles.


### Typical User Scenario  

A dealership manager wants to decide:

- Which models to stock next year  
- Whether electric or hybrid demand is increasing  
- Which colors and configurations sell best
